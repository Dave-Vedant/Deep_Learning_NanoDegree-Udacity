# Dog Breed Image Classification Algorithm for Application 

### Objective :
Main objective of this project is to develope proper algorithm procedure for dog breed image classification application. Algorithm must understand the difference between human and dogs, as most of images of dogs also have image of owner with it. For fun part Algorithm can identiy human as nearest dog breed type features. 

#### Technology :
- I used **Google colaboratory environment** as Jupyter Notebook, because it is easy to install all required dependencies as per need.
- **Python 3.7** is basic need for programming purpose.
- I used **PyTorch library (specically, Pytorch vision and basic)** for Neural Network architecture and for other machine learning procedure.
- Other **libraries** are : (1) matplotlib (2) Numpy (3) Pandas (4) PIL (5) Beautifulsoup(if needed) 
- For GPU, I used **CUDA**, and that's why you can see the use of **Tesla P4 and Tesla P 100**, in different notebooks. [ *GPU are better than TPU*  ]

#### Dependencies 
All dependencies, you can find in [Requirement.txt file]() in main project.Orca. (I use the same env. for all the project across my deeplearing module.
