### Project Intuition : 
Customer sentient are serious concern for any industry. Specially, when your prime goal is to provide best services to Customer. Customer Satisfaction always depends on their response. In big data world, it is not easy to identify each person's sentiment. Machine learning give use leverage to classify positive and negative reviews so, we can understand the problem betterly, and reach unsatisfy customer personally. 

### Goal:
- Identifing review position. [Positive/ Negative]
- Deploy model to Web to show customer their review position. 


### Project Flow 
1. Data Preparation
2. Extract "bag of words" algo. for NLP approach
3. XGBoost Random Forest Implementation (searching right algorithm, using AWS algo. lib)
4. Configure AWS for training
5. Model training, validation 
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
7. Model Testing
8. End Point generation
9. API gateway generation
10. [Index.html](https://github.com/vedantdave77/project.Orca/blob/master/Sentiment%20Web%20Application%20Deployment%20%5BAWS%20-%20SageMaker%5D/Web_Application.html) creation
11. Deployment
12. Final Testing  (real review checking)
